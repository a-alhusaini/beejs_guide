# What is this?

I've been tracking my work on Beej's guide to C. These are exercises inspired by or copied from 
the book. I wrote everything here to try and achieve a beginner's understanding of C. I succeeded.

Topics covered include:

- pointers and pointer arithmetic
- pointer decay
- some of the stdio functions like fopen and the FILE * datatype.
- structs
- functions
- the basics of data types
- the power of void * and pointer casting


As of this writing, I've successfully completed the basics of C. Including memory management
along with all the topics covered above. I believe this format is no longer conducive to further learning.

At some point you need to us your skills to develop something useful. And now that I understand the language
I believe further mastery will be achieved through working on various projects/exercises.

The book covers much more topics than the ones I've completed. I've only finished ~25% of the book so far.
but like I said above, this sort of book-learning is only good for so long.

Time to move on to bigger and better projects. With C, of course!
